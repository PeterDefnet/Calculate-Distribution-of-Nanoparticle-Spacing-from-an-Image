# Calculate-Nanoparticle-Spacing-from-an-Image
I calculate the distribution of interparticle spacing between thousands of nanoparticles randomly positioned on a substrate. I used a Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filter to extract (x,y) coordinates of each particle from the input image, then wrote an algorithm to compare their distances.
